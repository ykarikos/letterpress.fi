Letterpress.fi
==============

Attempt to create a clone for Letterpress (http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/)
in the web using Finnish language.

Todo:
 * submit, check and save played words
 * form for playerTwo joining a game -> how to authenticate playerOne and playerTwo?
 * count points
 * check tile ownerships and update locked tiles
 * fix index form look&feel
 * use weighed alphabet (based on letter frequency)x
 * use mongodb

Ideas for improvement:
 * language selection

Current bugs:
 * Firefox: displays too bold font
 * Firefox: jquery sortable triggers click
