Letterpress.fi
==============

Attempt to create a clone for Letterpress (http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/)
in the web using Finnish language.

Todo:
 * form for playerTwo joining a game 
 -> how to authenticate playerOne and playerTwo?
 -> how to indicate that playerTwo has not yet joined
 * fix index page form look&feel
 * use weighed alphabet (based on letter frequency)
 * count scores when selecting tiles before submitting
 * pass turn

Ideas for improvement:
 * language selection

Current bugs:
 * Firefox: displays too bold font
 * Firefox: jquery sortable triggers click
 * Firefox: clear and submit button font size
