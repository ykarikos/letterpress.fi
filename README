Letterpress.fi
==============

Attempt to create a clone for Letterpress (http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/)
in the web using Finnish language.

Ideas for improvement:
 * authenticate players properly (e.g. via Google) and/or make
   sure that a game can not be hijacked
 * when another player has played a tile, reload the page less violently:
   preserve selected tiles 
 * use player gravatars instead of icons
 * language selection (e.g. de, sv, en)
 * list player's games
 * list leaderboard
 * show player names more clearly
 * show rules
 * Github banner

Current bugs:
 * Firefox: displays too bold font
 * Firefox: dragging a tile puts it back - jquery sortable triggers click
 * prefixes of played words are allowed
 * when a word is submitted, tiles are not checked against the word
