Letterpress.fi
==============

Attempt to create a clone for Letterpress (http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/)
in the web using Finnish language.

Todo:
 * save and display used words and use for checking
 * form for playerTwo joining a game 
 -> how to authenticate playerOne and playerTwo?
 -> how to indicate that playerTwo has not yet joined
 * count points correctly
 * check tile ownerships and update locked tiles
 * fix index page form look&feel
 * use weighed alphabet (based on letter frequency)
 * check when the game ends 

Ideas for improvement:
 * use mongodb
 * language selection

Current bugs:
 * Firefox: displays too bold font
 * Firefox: jquery sortable triggers click
