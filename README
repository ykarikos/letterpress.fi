Letterpress.fi
==============

Attempt to create a clone for Letterpress (http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/)
in the web using Finnish language.

Ideas for improvement:
 * authenticate players properly (e.g. via Google) and/or make
   sure that a game can not be hijacked
 * when another player has played a tile, reload the page less violently:
   preserve selected tiles 
 * language selection
 * list player's games
 * list leaderboard

Current bugs:
 * Firefox: displays too bold font
 * Firefox: jquery sortable triggers click
